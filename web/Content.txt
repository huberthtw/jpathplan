1. About
Apparate is an application to visualise and learn about various path planning algorithms ranging 
from the most popular A* to various extensions of A* for both incremental and real-time search. 
Incremental search algorithms try to solve a series of similar path-planning problems by reusing 
information generated during the previous iterations of search. However, real-time algorithms try 
to search and return a part of optimal path in real time. To gain a deeper understanding of this 
area and the algorithms, please read the papers from the Related Papers section.

Apparate uses the JPathPlan: A library of path planning algorithms, which was built as a part of
minor thesis entitled "Path Planning in Agents with Incomplete Information in Dynamic 
Environments" <- href to thesis. This library provides a domain-independent implementation of path
planning algorithms and also provides in interface to implement new algorithms in the same manner.


2. Downloads
Apparate can be either downloaded or run as an applet. The downloadable archive file contains a 
README and a HOW-TO file which contain instructions on how to install and use the application. It 
also contains a HOW-TO file for the JPathPlan library which has instructions on how the library can 
be used in other client applications.
